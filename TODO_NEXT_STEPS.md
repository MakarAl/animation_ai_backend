# TODO: Next Steps for Animation Interpolation App

## User Experience
- [ ] Add visual indicator for empty slots in the timeline and preview (e.g., checkerboard or faded overlay)
- [ ] Allow user to scrub or jump to next/previous keyframe or generated frame quickly
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for timeline navigation and playback controls

## Robustness
- [ ] Handle edge cases where generated images fail to load (show error or retry)
- [ ] Add tests for timeline slot assignment and playback logic
- [ ] Ensure undo/redo works correctly with generated in-betweens

## Features
- [ ] Allow user to select and delete generated in-betweens
- [ ] Support batch export of timeline as video or GIF
- [ ] Add support for multiple scenes/projects
- [ ] Integrate more interpolation engines and allow engine selection per job
- [ ] Add per-frame metadata (e.g., notes, tags)
